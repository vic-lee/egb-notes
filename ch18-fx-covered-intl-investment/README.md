## Forward exchange rate
- Exchange rate risk: change in exchange rate -> change in value, income, wealth
	- e.g., in foreign markets, `return = asset return + exchange rate fluctuations`
	- 2 responses to exchange rate risk:
		- hedging
		- Speculating
### Hedging
- Agree on a forward exchange rate in the future to avoid exchange rate risk
- The ~future spot rate may be above, below, or equal your forward exchange rate~
### Speculating
- Bet on your expected future spot rate
- **speculators’ pressures on S&D => forward exchange rate == avg. expected future spot rate**
- Other kinds of foreign exchange contracts
	- Futures
		- see below
	- Options
		- pay a premium for the option
		- Protected downside
	- Swaps
		- essentially a set of spot and foreign exchanges packed into one contract
#### Differences b/t futures contract and forward forex contract
1. Futures contract is ~standardized~ and thus ~tradable~; forward forex contract is not
2. Futures contract requires a ~margin~, forward forex contract does not
3. Futures contract ~clears P&Ls daily~ based on that day’s spot rate, and margin account needs to be refilled; this is not applicable to forward forex contract
4. Futures contract is ~accessible~ to ordinary people and small businesses; forward forex contract is usually for large transactions & large corporations

## Covered International Investment
- Covered international investment = hedged international investment
- **covered interest differential**
	- `CD = (1+i_uk)*(f/e) - (1+i_us)`
	- `e: current spot rate; f: forward foreign exchange rate`
- **Forward Premium**
	- `F = (f - e)/e`: proportionate difference between current forward exchange rate and current spot value
- **covered interest differential — approx.**
	- `CD = F + (i_uk - i_us)`
		- forward premium: current forward exchange rate vs. current spot value
		- Interest differential
### Covered interest arbitrage
- If interest rate is higher in one country than another, then one is incentivized to
	1. Buy in foreign currency
	2. Put foreign currency into treasury bills
	3. Purchase forward contract to cover his position (at the current spot rate)
	4. Risk-less profit in interest rate difference months later
- If many people attempt this arbitrage:
	- country with high interest rate would have higher demand -> stronger currency
	- Overtime, country with lower interest rate tend to raise interest rate;
	- Country with higher interest rate tend to lower interest rate
### Covered interest parity
- **covered interest parity**: `F + (i_uk) = i_us`
	- covered return on foreign investment ( interest + foreign exchange return (could be negative)) == comparable domestic investment return
	- **a country with a lower interest rate than the U.S. will have a forward premium on its currency**
	- Covered interest parity connects 4 factors together:
		1. Current forward exchange rate
		2. Current spot rate
		3. Interest rate in foreign country
		4. Interest rate in domestic country

## Uncovered interest parity
- **Expected uncovered interest differential**
	- `EUD = (1 + i_uk) * (e_ex / e) - (1 + i_us)`
	- $$EUD = (1 + i_{uk}) \times \frac{e^{ex}}{e} - (1 + i_{us})$$
	- **approx**: `EUD = Expected appreciation + (i_uk - i_us)`
		- expected return = expected appreciation of FX + interest differential
- Incentives for taking an uncovered position
	- expected appreciation > 0
	- Expected appreciation < 0, ~but the risk of the overall portfolio has decreased due to diversification~
- **uncovered interest parity (international fisher effect)**
	- `expected appreciation of FX = i_us - i_uk`
		- FX appreciation or depreciation is equal to interest differential
	- `expected appreciation of FX + i_uk = i_us`
		- foreign return + FX return == return on comparable domestic investment

## Evidence on covered / uncovered interest parity
### On covered interest parity
![](Ch18:%20FX%20and%20Covered:Uncovered%20Int%E2%80%99l%20Investment/FullSizeRender.jpg)
- Strong evidence that covered interest parity holds
- Deviates due to ~actual / threatened government **capital controls**~
	- see France from 1981-1986
- Covered interest parity breaks down in inefficient financial market
	- capital control
	- Less liquid supply of funds
	- Counter party risk when carrying out futures contracts
	- See how covered interest parity breaks down during the financial crisis
		- ![](Ch18:%20FX%20and%20Covered:Uncovered%20Int%E2%80%99l%20Investment/FullSizeRender%202.jpg)
			- banks are not exploiting covered interest differentials due to higher-than-normal counter-party risk
### On uncovered interest parity
- Hard to measure investors’ expected future spot rate
- Empirical evidence not strong
- Also indicates exchange-rate risk matters
